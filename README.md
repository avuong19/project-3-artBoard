 ## Description
 ArtBoard is a site for artists, art enthusiasts, and art lovers alike to discuss and explore new works of art. The goal of ArtBoard is to foster a community for appreciation of art as well as an interest in building  and developing art education. The site utilizes the MET Museum's API to access thousands of popular historical and modern works. Users will be able to set up an account, login, search for artworks contained in the MET's API, and comment on works.

 We have planned many future developments for this site which include the ability to add friends, save works, have a dashboard of popular trending works, reply to and like comments, and refinement of the UI. Due to technical difficulties and time constraints, these improvements will be made after our project is submitted for grading. 

  ## Installation
